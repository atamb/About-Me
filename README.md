# my-first-repo
Hi I'm Ata from Istanbul/Turkey. I am currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in electrical and electronics engineering at Marmara University and business administration at Anadolu University.

At the same time, I have intermediate c# and arduino coding skills. I also have beginner level knowledge of python and c. I mainly deal with designing 2D games in Unity.The reason why I joined github is to improve my game coding skills by participating in projects and contribute to these projects.
