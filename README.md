# About-Me
Hi I'm Ata from Istanbul/Turkey.

I am focused on deepening my career in software development, game development, and artificial intelligence. I graduated from Marmara University with a GPA of 2.92 in Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am currently continuing my education in Business Administration at Anadolu University. Throughout my academic life, I have been actively involved in game development and AI projects.

Among my standout projects is the development of a digital twin for the E10 bus line, intended for use by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality. With this project, I aimed to demonstrate the potential of electric buses to enhance efficiency and sustainability in urban transportation. Additionally, I optimized traffic flow by designing an AI-driven traffic control system simulation for Bağdat Avenue with a group of friends. This project was accepted for presentation at Alanya University's iConTech conference.

In the field of game development, I led the creation of "Kirik Evren," a hybrid 2D-3D platformer that won third place at the Aydın Goat GameJam, along with other similar games. You can review my other games on my GitHub and itch.io profiles linked on my profile. Additionally, during my internship at HAVELSAN, I worked on real-time image processing and MQTT data publishing projects.

My skills in software development and project management are supported by both technical expertise and leadership abilities. Alongside my advanced English proficiency, I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, C, and C#, and I have experience with various tools and technologies, including Unity, Docker, and Apache NiFi. I aim to contribute to the tech and software industry by leading innovative projects throughout my career.
